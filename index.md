## Welcome to the My Lockdown Lifestyle Survey – To Zoom or not to Zoom: How has your lifestyle changed during lockdown? 

In addition to this survey, an app is being developed by UCL IRDR Centre for dPHE as part of the research project investigating how people’s lifestyles have changed during the crisis. The app is complemented by the #MyLockdownJournal competition on Twitter and Instagram - why not join in?

If you have any questions or suggestions, we would be delighted to hear from you on irdr.dphe@ucl.ac.uk 

## Privacy Policy ##

University College London IRDR Centre for Digital Public Health in Emergencies (dPHE) designed the SurveyMonkey questionnaires. The study has received ethical approval by UCL Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction.  
 
UCL, a company incorporated by Royal Charter (number RC 000631), is the entity that determines how and why your personal data is processed. This means that UCL is the ‘controller’ of your personal data for the purposes of data protection law.
 
This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information of anyone who decides to take part in our research our use our Service.
 
If you choose to take part in this research, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service and for our research study on human lifestyle changes in relation to COVID-19. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
 
## Information Collection and Use ##

We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. We will use your personal data, your email address - where given, in the following circumstances: To invite you to the other parts of this research study and to conduct research into the way citizens changed their lifestyle during and after the lockdown in order to inform public health policymakers and future strategies on support for citizens in similar crises and pandemics. 

The information collected will be anonymised and included in project datasets and shared only with researchers working on the project. 

Where the processing is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the details set out below. Please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

Should you use our My Lockdown Journal research app, then your email address may be used to link the two data sets, but your data will remain pseudonymised according to the privacy policies of both research projects.

We may also use anonymised data, meaning data from which you cannot be identified, for the purposes of:
* Service evaluation;
* Education and research; or
* Fundraising and promotional purposes.

Only de-identified anonymous data will be used in published reports or journals and at conferences. Results of the study and analyses will be included in published international journal articles and conferences, seminars, workshops, websites, social media, newspaper articles, and future proposal bids. We will share the published results with users who provide us with a valid email address.

## Lawful basis for processing ##

Data protection laws require us to meet certain conditions before we are allowed to use your data in the manner described in this notice, including having a ‘legal basis’ for the processing. Where we process special category personal data or criminal convictions information, we are required to establish an additional legal basis for processing that data.

The main legal bases on which your personal data are generally processed for research purposes are explained below.

For all information – as cited by Article 6(1)(e) of GDPR: 
* Performance of a task in the public interest: when carrying out our core functions such as research, in addition to activities that are ancillary to our core functions, UCL will be performing a task in the public interest. For further details on the ‘public task’ legal basis for processing, please see our [Statement of Tasks in the Public Interest](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/legal-services/sites/legal-services/files/ucl_statement_of_tasks_in_the_public_interest_-_august_2018.pdf).

For special category data and information relating to criminal convictions/offences – as cited by Article 9(2)(j), based on Schedule 1, Para 4 of the Data Protection Act 2018:
* Research purposes: in the context of research, the additional lawful basis upon which we will process your personal information is usually that the processing is necessary for archiving purposes, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes.


## Data retention ##
We ask our researchers to de-identify information wherever possible (anonymisation or pseudonymisation). Information where you can be identified will, as such, be kept for a minimum amount of time and in accordance with the research objectives. We may, however, keep consent forms which contain personal information for a number of years after the research has been completed, as this is sometimes a requirement of the research’s funder.

For some research projects we cannot de-identify the information as it is necessary for achieving the outcome of the research. For such projects, we store your personal information as part of the research for the duration of the project and for a defined period after the project has ended. This is usually defined by external regulations but may be defined by our own policies and procedures. In this project your data will be kept for up to 5 years after the end of the research project and in accordance with data protection regulations.

Further details about how long personal information obtained for research is kept can be found in our [Data Retention Schedule](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/about-us/records-office/records-retention).

## Your rights ##

Under data protection legislation you have certain individual rights in relation to the personal information we hold about you. For the purposes of research where such individual rights would seriously impair research outcomes, such rights are limited. However, subject to certain conditions, you have the following rights in relation to your personal data:

Right 1: A right to access personal data held by us about you.  Your right of access can be exercised at any time by contacting us at data-protection@ucl.ac.uk or Data Protection Officer, UCL Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT.

Right 2: A right to require us to rectify any inaccurate personal data held by us about you.

Right 3: A right to require us to erase personal data held by us about you.  This right will only apply where, for example, we no longer need to use the personal data to achieve the purpose we collected it for; or where you withdraw your consent if we are using your personal data based on your consent; or where you object to the way we process your data (in line with Right 6 below).

Right 4: A right to restrict our processing of personal data held by us about you.  This right will only apply where, for example, you dispute the accuracy of the personal data held by us; or where you would have the right to require us to erase the personal data but would prefer that our processing is restricted instead; or where we no longer need to use the personal data to achieve the purpose we collected it for, but we require the data for the purposes of dealing with legal claims.

Right 5: A right to receive personal data, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to require us to transfer this personal data to another organisation.

Right 6: A right to object to our processing of personal data held by us about you.

Right 7: A right to withdraw your consent, where we are relying on it to use your personal data.

Right 8: A right to ask us not to use information about you in a way that allows computers to make decisions about you and ask us to stop.  

It is important to understand that the extent to which these rights apply to research will vary and that in some circumstances your rights may be restricted.

If you notify us (using the contact details set out below) that you wish to exercise any of the above rights and it is considered necessary to refuse to comply with any of your individual rights, you will be informed of the decision within one month and you also have the right to complain about our decision to the Information Commissioner’s Office (see the ‘who do I contact with questions’ section below for further detail on this).

Please also note that we can only comply with a request to exercise your rights during the period for which we hold personal information about you. If that information has been irreversibly anonymised and has become part of the research data set, it will no longer be possible for us to access your personal information.

If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact the Data Protection Officer: data-protection@ucl.ac.uk
